    It is calculated using the formula: <strong>BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)<sup>2</sup></strong>. It helps classify individuals 
    into categories such as
    Underweight: BMI<18.5
    Normal weight:18.5-24.9
    Overweight:25-29.9
    Obesity:BMI>30
    Why BMI is Important?
    BMI is important because it provides a quick and reliable way to assess weight relative to height and estimate body fat percentage.
    It's used as a screening tool for identigying individuals at increased risk of chronic diseases abd can help guide healthcare providers in developing personalised health plans.

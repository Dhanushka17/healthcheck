<h1>Introduction to BMI</h1>
<p>
    Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple and widely used measure to estimate a person's body fat based on weight and height.
    It is calculated using the formula: <strong>BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)<sup>2</sup></strong>. It helps classify individuals 
    into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

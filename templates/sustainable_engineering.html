<h1>Sustainable Engineering and BMI</h1>

<div class="intro-section">
    <p>
        Sustainable engineering practices can contribute to public health initiatives aimed at maintaining healthy BMI ranges
        across populations. By designing communities, cities, and environments that promote physical activity and healthy living,
        engineers play a crucial role in addressing global health challenges related to obesity and undernutrition.

    <h2>Case Studies in Sustainable Health Engineering</h2>
    
    <div class="case-study">
        <h3>Copenhagen's Cycling Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
            The city of Copenhagen has invested heavily in cycling infrastructure, creating a comprehensive network of separated bike lanes, 
            bicycle highways, and cyclist-friendly traffic signals. This has resulted in 62% of residents using bicycles for daily commuting, 
            contributing to Denmark having one of the lowest obesity rates in Europe.

    <div class="case-study">
        <h3>Singapore's Food Security Master Plan</h3>
        <p>
            Singapore has implemented innovative urban farming solutions, including rooftop gardens and vertical farms, 
            to increase local food production in the land-scarce city-state. These engineering solutions have increased access to fresh 
            produce while creating educational opportunities about nutrition and sustainable eating.

    <div class="case-study">
        <h3>South Korea's Smart City Health Initiatives</h3>
        <p>
            In Songdo International Business District, engineers have designed a city with extensive green spaces, pedestrian pathways, 
            and integrated health monitoring systems. The city includes pneumatic waste disposal systems (eliminating garbage trucks), 
            extensive bike paths, and centralized building systems that reduce pollution while encouraging active lifestyles.

<div class="conclusion">
    <p>
        These engineering solutions recognize that maintaining a healthy BMI is not just an individual responsibility but also 
        depends on creating environments and systems that make healthy choices more accessible to everyone. Sustainable engineering 
        approaches can create lasting improvements in public health by addressing the root environmental and systemic factors that 
        influence BMI and other health metrics across populations.

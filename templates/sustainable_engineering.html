<h1>Sustainable Engineering and BMI</h1>
<p>
    Sustainable engineering practices can contribute to public health initiatives aimed at maintaining healthy BMI ranges
    across populations. By designing communities, cities, and environments that promote physical activity and healthy living,
    engineers play a crucial role in addressing global health challenges related to obesity and undernutrition.
</p>

<h2>Key Sustainable Engineering Approaches:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Creating walkable cities and neighborhoods that encourage physical activity</li>
    <li><strong>Food Systems:</strong> Engineering sustainable food production and distribution systems</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare Infrastructure:</strong> Developing accessible facilities for health monitoring and education</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Tools:</strong> Creating sustainable digital and physical tools for health education</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These engineering solutions recognize that maintaining a healthy BMI is not just an individual responsibility but also 
    depends on creating environments and systems that make healthy choices more accessible to everyone.
